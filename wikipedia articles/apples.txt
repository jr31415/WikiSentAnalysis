Main
An apple is the round, edible fruit of an apple tree (Malus
spp.). Fruit trees of the orchard or domestic apple
(Malus domestica), the most widely grown in the genus,
are cultivated worldwide. The tree originated in Central
Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia
before they were introduced to North America by
European colonists. Apples have cultural significance in
many mythologies (including Norse and Greek) and
religions (such as Christianity in Europe).
Apples grown from seeds tend to be very different from
those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently
lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes,
including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are
propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees
grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much
slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to
control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting
tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different
cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including
cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production.
Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest
problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic
and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was
sequenced as part of research on disease control and
selective breeding in apple production.

_____Etymology
The word apple is derived from Old English æppel,
meaning "fruit", not specifically the apple.[4] That in turn
is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz,
descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.
[5] As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a
generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can be
compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression
appel of paradis, meaning a banana.

_____Description
The apple tree is deciduous, generally standing from 2 to
4.5 metres (6 to 15 feet) tall in cultivation and up to 15 m
(49 ft) in the wild, though more typically 2 to 10 m (6.5 to
33 ft).[6][2] When cultivated, the size, shape and branch
density are determined by rootstock selection and

trimming method.[6] Apple trees may naturally have a rounded to erect crown with a dense canopy
of leaves.[7] The bark of the trunk is dark gray or gray-brown, but young branches are reddish or
dark-brown with a smooth texture.[2][8] Young twigs are covered in fine downy hairs; they become
hairless when older.[8]
The buds are egg-shaped and dark red or purple in color; they range in size from 3 to 5 millimeters,
but are usually less than 4 mm. The bud scales have very hairy edges. When emerging from the
buds, the leaves are convolute, meaning that their edges overlap each other.[2] Leaves can be
simple ovals (elliptic), medium or wide in width, somewhat egg-shaped with the wider portion
toward their base (ovate), or even with sides that are more parallel to each other instead of curved
(oblong) with a narrow pointed end.[8][2] The edges have broadly-angled teeth, but do not have
lobes. The top surface of the leaves are glabrescent, almost hairless, while the undersides are
densely covered in fine hairs.[2] The leaves are attached alternately by short leaf stems 1-to-3.5 cm
(1⁄2-to-11⁄2 in) long.[7][2]
Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced
on spurs and some long shoots.
and fade to white or light pink when fully open with each flower 3-to-4-centimeter (1-to-11⁄2-inch)
in diameter.[2] The five-petaled flowers are group in an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 3–7
[6] When the flower buds first begin to open the petals are rose-pink
flowers.[9] The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can
develop a larger fruit.[7] Open apple blossoms are damaged by even brief exposures to
temperatures −2 °C (28 °F) or less, although the overwintering wood and buds are hardy down to
−40 °C (−40 °F).[9]

_____Fruit
The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn.
[2] The true fruits or carpels are the
harder interior chambers inside the apple's core. There are usually five carpels inside an apple, but
there may be as few as three. Each of the chambers contains one or two seeds.[10] The edible flesh
is formed from the receptacle at the base of the flower.[11]
The seeds are egg- to pear-shaped and may be colored from light brown or tan to a very dark
brown, often with red shades or even purplish-black. They may have a blunt or sharp point.[12] The
five sepals remain attached and stand out from the surface of the apple.[2]
The size of the fruit varies widely between cultivars, but generally has a diameter between 2.5 and
12 cm (1 and 5 in).[8] The shape is quite variable and may be nearly round, elongated, conical, or
short and wide.[13]
The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of
ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The overcolor amount can
be 0–100%.[14] The skin may be wholly or partly russeted, making it rough and brown. The skin is
covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.
[15] The skin may also be marked with scattered
dots.[2] The flesh is generally pale yellowish-white, though it can be pink, yellow or green.[14]

_____Chemistry
Important volatile compounds in apples that contribute to their scent and flavour include
acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 1-butanal, ethanol, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethyl
propionate, ethyl 2-methylpropionate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methyl butyrate, hexanal, 1-butanol,
3-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 1-propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, amyl acetate, 2-
methyl-1-butanol, trans-2-hexenal, ethyl hexanoate, hexanol.

_____Taxonomy
The apple as a species has more than 100 alternative scientific names, or synonyms.
[18] In modern
times, Malus pumila and Malus domestica are the two main names in use. M. pumila is the older
name, but M. domestica has become much more commonly used starting in the 21st century,
especially in the western world. Two proposals were made to make M. domestica a conserved
2014, but in April 2017 the Committee decided, with a narrow majority, that the newly popular
name should be conserved.[19] The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June 2017 to
approve this change, officially conserving M. domestica.
[20] Nevertheless, some works published
after 2017 still use M. pumila as the correct name, under an alternate taxonomy.[3]
name: the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular Plants of the IAPT in
When first classified by Linnaeus in 1753, the pears, apples, and quinces were combined into one
genus that he named Pyrus and he named the apple as Pyrus malus. This was widely accepted,
however the botanist Philip Miller published an alternate classification in The Gardeners
Dictionary with the apple species separated from Pyrus in 1754. He did not clearly indicate that by
Malus pumila he meant the domesticated apple. Nonetheless, it was used as such by many
botanists. When Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen published his scientific description of the apple in
1803 it may have been a new combination of P. malus var. domestica, but this was not directly
referenced by Borkhausen.[18] The earliest use of var. domestica for the apple was by Georg Adolf
Suckow in 1786.[3]

_____Genome
Apples are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes per cell (though triploid cultivars, with three
sets, are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately
650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one
in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[21] However, this first whole genome
sequence contained several errors,[22] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid
apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly.
Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole genome
sequences of higher quality.[23][24]
The first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[21] though the
more recent genome sequences support estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding
genes.[23][24] The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild
ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions
has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following
domestication.[25]
