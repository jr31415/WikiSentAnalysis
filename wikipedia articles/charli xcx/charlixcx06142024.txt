In 2010, she signed a recording contract with Asylum Records, releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.

In 2012, Charli xcx rose to prominence collaborating with Swedish duo Icona Pop on "I Love It", which became an international success. Her debut studio album, True Romance (2013), was released to positive reception but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the hook and bridge to "Fancy" by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, which finished the year as one of the best-selling singles worldwide and was nominated for two Grammy Awards. The same year, Charli xcx released "Boom Clap", which became her first solo top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100.

_____Early life
Charlotte Emma Aitchison was born in Cambridge on 2 August 1992, the only child of nurse and flight attendant Shameera and entrepreneur and show booker Jon Aitchison. Her mother was born into a Gujarati Indian family in Uganda, while her father is Scottish.[4] She grew up in Start Hill, Essex,[5][6] and attended Bishop's Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford.[7] She demonstrated an affinity for music from an early age, being interested in acts such as the Spice Girls and Britney Spears, and began writing songs at the age of 14.[8][9]

_____Career
At 14, Aitchison persuaded her parents to grant her a loan to record her first album, 14,[10][11] and in early 2008, began posting songs from the album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page. This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves and parties in East London, who invited her to perform at them.[6][12] She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX, which was her MSN Messenger display name when she was younger.[13] Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended several raves with her.[14] In late 2008, while 14 was never commercially released,[15] she released the two singles "!Franchesckaar!" and double A-side "Emelline"/"Art Bitch", under Orgy Music.[16][17] She has since frequently expressed her distaste for her music of the time, going as far to call it "gimmicky dance tracks" and "fucking terrible Myspace music".[12][18] At the age of 18, Charli moved to London to study for a fine art degree at UCL's Slade School of Fine Art but dropped out in her second year.[4]

In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to Asylum Records. She later described herself as being "lost". In an interview with The Guardian, Charli XCX said: "I was still in school, I'd just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And when I got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."[15] She eventually flew out to Los Angeles to meet producers, and found it "wasn't working out for me" until she met with American producer Ariel Rechtshaid. They had a two-hour session and wrote the song "Stay Away". She stated that's "when things started to come together".[19][15] Early in 2011, she was featured on the Alex Metric single "End of the World". She left during the second year of her degree course at the Slade School of Fine Art to focus on her music career,[20][21] and in May and November 2011, she released the singles "Stay Away" and "Nuclear Seasons" respectively, and gained attention from music website Pitchfork, where she earned "Best New Track" accolades for both; the former was eventually named to the site's "Best Tracks of 2011" list.[22][23][24]

In addition to Rechtshaid, she began working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger. He sent her two beats, and she quickly wrote songs for each, one of which became "I Love It" and the other of which became "You're the One".[25] She stated she didn't end up releasing "I Love It" herself as she could not reconcile it with her sound,[26] but in 2012, Swedish duo Icona Pop re-recorded the song and released it as a single featuring her vocals. The song became an international hit, hitting number 1 in Charli's home country and climbing to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2013.[27][28] In June, she released "You're the One" as a single from her EP of the same name, followed by her debut mixtape Heartbreaks and Earthquakes, a one-track file consisting of eight songs including a cover of the Blood Orange song "Champagne Coast" and Odd Future's remix of "You're the One".[29][30][31] On Halloween, she released a new song called "Cloud Aura" featuring Brooke Candy,[32] followed by her second mixtape Super Ultra, released exclusively through her website in November.[33][34][35] In early 2013, she released "You (Ha Ha Ha)" and announced her debut album,[36] followed by "What I Like" in March.[37] True Romance was released in April 2013. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Albums Chart,[38] at number five on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers, and at number 11 on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart.[39] The album was received well by music critics, earning a 76/100 on Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[40] In May, she released "Just Desserts", a song with Welsh singer-songwriter Marina.[41]

Charli XCX began writing her second album in mid-2013, saying she initially wanted to go to India to record, but later decided she wanted to record in France, she said: "Two months ago, I wanted to go to India and record it, and now I want to record it in France. So I feel like nothing is definite – like, I feel very all-over-the-place at the moment. But at the moment, my heart's set on going to France and recording it, but that was different two months ago, so who knows what's going to happen?"[42] Frustrated with the music industry, she ended up going to Sweden, isolating herself from her record label, and made a punk-inspired album over a month. Working on the album with Patrik Berger, they made it at a fast pace, saying that it is "not thought-about, everything really spontaneous [...] We don't think — it's like the first thing that comes out of my mouth is the cut on the record,"[43][44] however it was eventually scrapped for a more "pop-oriented" album. The album included a song called "Mow That Lawn", which was debuted live a year later at Ilosaarirock Festival in Finland.[45]

In late 2013, "SuperLove" was released as the lead single from the album,[46] and reached number sixty-two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Charli's first solo entry on the chart.[47] In January 2014, she released a song called "Allergic to Love" on her SoundCloud.[48] While writing the album, she did further sessions with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, Rostam Batmanglij from Vampire Weekend, production duo Stargate, John Hill, and a session with Dr. Luke which she said "wasn't for me”. In an interview with DIY magazine, she stated that she wrote the record for girls and wants them to feel "a sense of empowerment".[49] Charli explained in her tour diary with Replay Laserblast that the record's genre is still pop, but has a very shouty, girl-power, girl-gang, Bow Wow Wow feel to it at the same time.[50] The album was influenced by the Hives, Weezer, the Ramones and 1960s yé-yé music.[51] "SuperLove" was eventually scrapped from the album.

In early 2014, Charli XCX was featured on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's single "Fancy";[52] the track topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming both artists' first number-one single on the chart.[53][54] Charli XCX expanded her portfolio of songwriting for other artists during this period, with credits on Azalea's 2014 single "Beg for It", Ryn Weaver's debut single "OctaHate", and material for acts including Sky Ferreira, Neon Jungle, Rihanna, and Gwen Stefani.[55] In mid-2014, Charli XCX contributed the song "Boom Clap" to the soundtrack of the film The Fault in Our Stars. "Boom Clap" peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100[56] and at number six in the UK,[57] and was certified platinum in Australia.[58] In August, Sucker was announced to be released in October, along with the lead single "Break the Rules". She said the song came out about after she had made her punk album in Sweden, when she "came out of the other side of that punk phase and translated it into something more pop." She stated that the album was "obviously, [...] about not giving a fuck."[59] The album was pushed back the next month due to the success of "Boom Clap",[60] and was officially released in December 2014 in North America and February 2015 in Europe. It debuted at number 28 on the US Billboard 200, making it Charli's first album to enter the chart,[61] and number 15 on the UK Albums Chart.[62] The album's third single, "Doing It", featuring fellow British singer Rita Ora, was released in February, and peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.[63]

Charli XCX considers herself a feminist, and wrote one of the songs on Sucker, "Body of My Own" as a feminist statement.
